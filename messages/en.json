The word «Tamyr» exists in almost all languages of the region and carries a profound meaning: roots as a symbol of common history and connection to nature, veins as the symbol of pulse and movement within the region, the intertwining of vessels, spirit, and culture. It is a metaphor for connection, resilience, and shared heritage that unites Central Asia not by political borders, but by meaning, memory, and future. \n\n The visual representation of the countries of Central Asia is reflected in the Summit emblem (logo): different in shape, color, and character, yet standing together as a symbol of unity in diversity. The reference to the barcode shape also symbolizes a common space for dialogue and action, modern approaches, innovations, and the technological nature of solutions. \n\n The Summit reflects this image: one region – shared challenges – collective action. It will bring together governments, international organizations, the scientific community, business, civil society, and youth to lay the foundation for a shared, environmentally sustainable future.",

Уже в 1998 году город получил новое имя  Астана  и новый статус, став символом независимости, обновления и стратегического развития страны. \n\n 6 мая 1998 года Акмола была переименована в Астану, а в 1999 году получила звание «город мира» по решению ЮНЕСКО.
