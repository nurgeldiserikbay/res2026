			"aboutText2": "The Summit has received broad support from international partners, including the UN, the secretariats of the three Rio Conventions (UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)), UNECE, UNDP, UN-Habitat, UNEP, UNICEF, UNFPA, FAO, UNESCO, UNIDO, WMO, ILO, OECD, IEA, IRENA, ADB, WB, IMWI, SWITCH-Asia and other organizations.

At the heart of the initiative is the idea of 'Bir Tamyr' (One Root). The word 'tamyr' exists in almost all languages of the region and carries a deep image: roots of nature, veins of the earth, vessels of culture. This is a metaphor for connection, sustainability and common heritage that unites Central Asia not by political boundaries, but by meaning, memory and future. The Summit reflects this image: one region - common challenges - collective action. It will unite states, international organizations, the scientific community, business, civil society and youth to lay the foundation for a common environmentally sustainable future.",

Special attention will be paid to shaping the real needs of Central Asia in 'green' financing aimed at supporting adaptation measures, developing low-carbon technologies and strengthening the region's environmental resilience. \n\n The Summit creates a regional platform for dialogue and solidarity, strengthening cooperation between states, international organizations, scientific and business communities. It contributes to raising awareness of priority environmental issues, finding practical solutions and forming joint action plans for the future aimed at sustainable development of the region. The goal is to form specific initiatives and mechanisms for joint action. Adoption of a Joint Declaration of the Heads of State of Central Asia on Regional Cooperation in Ecology and Sustainable Development. \n\n Approval of the Regional Action Program with UN agencies (2026–2030) for a sustainable future of Central Asia, including regional initiatives on the thematic areas of the Summit, launch of new environmental projects and initiatives in the Summit's areas. Summit preparation began in 2024 and includes a series of regional consultations. The Summit will be the culmination of this process and give political impetus to the region's environmental agenda. The initiative strengthens the existing efforts of countries, complementing them with a regional dimension. The basis will be a coordinated environmental agenda, including updated climate goals of Central Asian countries."
