			"resText2": "The initiative's image is reflected in the phrase \"Bir Tamyr\" (Same Roots). The word \"tamyr\" exists in almost all the region's languages and carries a profound image: roots represent a shared history and connection to nature; veins symbolize the pulse and movement within the region, the interweaving of vessels, spirit, and culture. It is a metaphor for connection, sustainability, and a shared heritage that unites Central Asia not by political borders, but by meaning, memory, and future. Visually, the image of the Central Asian countries is reflected in the Summit's emblem (logo): different in shape, color, and character, yet standing side by side as a symbol of unity in diversity. A reference to the shape of a barcode also symbolizes a unified space for dialogue and action, modern approaches, innovation, and technological solutions. The Summit reflects this image: one region—common challenges—collective action. It will unite states, international organizations, the scientific community, businesses, the civil society, and youth to lay the foundation for a shared, environmentally sustainable future.",
