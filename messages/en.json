The word «Tamyr» exists in almost all languages of the region and carries a profound meaning: roots as a symbol of common history and connection to nature, veins as the symbol of pulse and movement within the region, the intertwining of vessels, spirit, and culture. It is a metaphor for connection, resilience, and shared heritage that unites Central Asia not by political borders, but by meaning, memory, and future. \n\n The visual representation of the countries of Central Asia is reflected in the Summit emblem (logo): different in shape, color, and character, yet standing together as a symbol of unity in diversity. The reference to the barcode shape also symbolizes a common space for dialogue and action, modern approaches, innovations, and the technological nature of solutions. \n\nThe Summit reflects this image: one region – shared challenges – collective action. It will bring together governments, international organizations, the scientific community, businesses, civil society, and youth to lay the foundation for a shared, environmentally sustainable future.",

				"historyText": "The history of Astana begins in 1830 with the construction of the Akmola fortress on the Ishim River. A city grew around it - an important trade and economic center of the region. \n\n During the Soviet period, the city was named Tselinograd and became one of the key centers for the development of virgin lands. It was then that it actively developed as an industrial, educational and scientific city, laying the foundation for future growth. \n\n In 1997, a historic decision was made to move the capital of Kazakhstan from Almaty to Akmola. Already in 1998, the city received a new name - Astana - and a new status, becoming a symbol of independence, renewal and strategic development of the country. \n\n On May 6, 1998, Akmola was renamed Astana, and in 1999 it received the title of \"City of Peace\" by UNESCO decision. Since 2000, the city has been a member of the International Assembly of Capitals and Major Cities.",

This legend reflects the connection between past, present and future. \n\n Today «Baiterek» is a popular tourist attraction and cultural symbol of the capital, attracting guests with its architecture and deep symbolic meaning.",
