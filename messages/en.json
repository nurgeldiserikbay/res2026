It is a metaphor for connection, resilience, and shared heritage that unites Central Asia not by political borders, but by meaning, memory, and future. \n\n The visual representation of the countries of Central Asia is reflected in the Summit emblem (logo): different in shape, color, and character, yet standing together as a symbol of unity in diversity. The reference to the barcode shape also symbolizes a common space for dialogue and action, modern approaches, innovations, and the technological nature of solutions. \n\nThe Summit reflects this image: one region – shared challenges – collective action. It will bring together governments, international organizations, the scientific community, businesses, civil society, and youth to lay the foundation for a shared, environmentally sustainable future.",
