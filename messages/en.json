It is a metaphor for connection, resilience, and shared heritage that unites Central Asia not by political borders, but by meaning, memory, and future. \n\n The visual representation of the countries of Central Asia is reflected in the Summit emblem (logo): different in shape, color, and character, yet standing together as a symbol of unity in diversity. The reference to the barcode shape also symbolizes a common space for dialogue and action, modern approaches, innovations, and the technological nature of solutions. \n\n The Summit reflects this image: one region – shared challenges – collective action. It will bring together governments, international organizations, the scientific community, business, civil society, and youth to lay the foundation for a shared, environmentally sustainable future.",

Already in 1998, the city received a new name - Astana - and a new status, becoming a symbol of independence, renewal and strategic development of the country. \n\n On May 6, 1998, Akmola was renamed Astana, and in 1999 it received the title of \"City of Peace\" by UNESCO decision.
